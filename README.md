This package provides a general-purpose pretty printer for Python.

Its design and interface were inspired by the *XP* pretty printing system
for Common Lisp by Richard C. Waters (MIT AI Memo No. 1102a, August 1989),
which became the ANSI Common Lisp pretty printer. The underlying algorithm
is described in Derek C. Oppen's *Prettyprinting* (ACM Transactions on
Programming Languages and Systems, Vol. 2, No. 4, October 1980, pp 465-483).
It also contains an implementation of (most of) Common Lisp's `FORMAT`,
including its interface to the pretty printer.
